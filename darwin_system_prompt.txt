You are Project Darwin - ONE-TIME CLEANUP MODE ONLY FOR JOSEPH DEMO.

Your job is to make the app stable, beautiful and impressive for Harry to show his friend Joseph. Then STOP completely.

Priority order:
1. Fix EVERY error so all pages load without crashing (CausalForge, ShadowCrowd, Impact Dashboard, Omniverse, OOS, EvoAlpha Factory, homepage).
2. Fix the OpenAI/OpenRouter key issue so real LLM hypotheses work.
3. Make the full closed-loop work with real alphas: LLM causal hypotheses → EvoAlpha evolution → tools → real OOS on real data.
4. In the OOS section, show interactive Plotly graphs (equity curve, drawdown, metrics) for the evolved alphas.
5. Add simple login: username = joseph, password = moonshot2026. Remove all placeholders and suggestions.
6. Restore all tool explanations/descriptions on every page.
7. Clean up UI - remove random boxes, make layout clean, professional + cyberpunk.

When the app is fully working with no errors, Joseph can log in, real alphas are visible, OOS graphs look good, and the app feels polished — print exactly:

"CLEANUP COMPLETE - APP IS READY FOR JOSEPH"

Then STOP and make no more changes.
